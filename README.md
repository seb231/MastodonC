CNS - central nervous system
ADD - attention deficit disorder
ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (more pronounced than ADD)
Amfetamine - a CNS stimulant
Stimulants only prescribed post unsuccessful psychological interventions
More common in children (?), sometimes grow out of it in adulthood (or perhaps they mean can be better handled by an adult)
Methylphenidate and atomoxetine used for ADHD management in children
Dexamfetamine and lisdexamfetamine used as an alternative (perhaps more side effects or more expensive?)
Side effects may be associated with pulse, blood pressure, psychiatric symptoms, appetite, weight and height, which all must be monitored

HSCIC - Health and Social Care Information Centre

Does data indicate ADHD prescriptions are growing or shrinking?
Does the data provide any suggestion as to why there is a change?

SHA - ?
PCT - ?
Practise - code for the practise
BNF code - code for the prescription, first 9 digits identify the chemical
BNF name - name of prescription
ITEMS - how many prescribed
NIC - net ingredient cost
ACT COST - actual cost
QUANTITY - number of tablets?
PERIOD - month

Pick out all BNF codes for drugs associated with ADHD record quantity or items for each drug

Need to collect drug codes for searches

Think I'll just go with a count of items per month per drug

Hypotheses for changes in ADHD drug usage
- cheaper
- more expensive
- more common in certain practises
- a particular drug becomes more accepted
- higher dosages being handed out

Plots
Date against amount - per.month
Date against amount per drug - per.month
